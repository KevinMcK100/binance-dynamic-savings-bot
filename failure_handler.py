class FailureHandler:

    Binance documentation states:

    "The time frame for subscription and redemption is open from 00:10-23:50(UTC) every day."

    https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360034998492

    This means there is a 20 minute window around 00:00 UTC each day where we will be unable to purchase or redeem any assets from Binance Flexible Savings.
    This handler attempts to handle the occasions where this (or any other) error may occur.

    It works as follows:

     - Assets which failed to rebalance are added to the rebalance_failures set.
     - Handler will constantly monitor that set for presence of failed assets.
     - If there failures present, we wait until Binance indicates the assets are available for purchasing and redemption again before re-attempting.
     - Once assets are able to be purchased and redeemed again, the failure handler will clear down the existing failures and attempt to rebalance all savings assets.
